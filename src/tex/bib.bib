  abstract = {Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts.Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

We find the correct known equations, including force laws and Hamiltonians, can be extracted from the neural network. We then apply our method to a non-trivial cosmology example-a detailed dark matter simulation-and discover a new analytic formula which can predict the concentration of dark matter from the mass distribution of nearby cosmic structures. The symbolic expressions extracted from the GNN using our technique also generalized to out-of-distribution data better than the GNN itself. Our approach offers alternative directions for interpreting neural networks and discovering novel physical principles from the representations they learn.},

Latent variables in a deep neural network are difficult to interpret because there are often many redundant such variables, and each relies on the interactions of many input features. Existing sparsity strategies target the parameters of a neural network, but do not guarantee a sparse dependency mapping from inputs to outputs, and as one can show empirically, often result in latent features which are dependent on the complex interactions of many input features. Our architecture and regularization scheme allows one to minimize the dependency of each latent feature in a deep network, making them much easier to interpret. This network can be used as a drop-in replacement for any multi-layer perceptron, and allows the user to fine-tune the dependencies of each output feature on each input feature. We show that this can greatly increase the applicability of symbolic regression-based Explainable AI approaches: for the first time, we show that we can recover the majority of the compressible Euler fluid equations from a trained graph neural network, purely by studying its internal latent features as trained with our model.},

For some set summarization problems, we argue this is the more interpretable choice compared to traditional aggregations, since it has functional resemblance to manual set summarization techniques. By staying closer to standard techniques, one can make more explicit connections with the learned functional form used by the model. We motivate and test this proposal with a large-scale summarization problem for cosmological simulations: one wishes to predict global properties of the universe via a set of observed structures distributed throughout space. We demonstrate comparable performance to a sum-pool and mean-pool operation over a range of hyperparameters for this problem. In doing so, we also increase the accuracy of traditional forecasting methods from 20\% error using our dataset down to 13\%, strengthening the argument for using such methods in Cosmology. We conclude by using our operator to symbolically discover an optimal cosmological feature for cosmic voids (which was not possible with traditional pooling operators) and discuss potential physical connections.},

We use symbolic regression to fit explicit algebraic equations to our trained model's message function and recover the symbolic form of Newton's law of gravitation without prior knowledge. We also show that our model generalizes better at inference time to systems with more bodies than had been experienced during training. Our approach is extensible, in principle, to any unknown interaction law learned by a graph network, and offers a valuable technique for interpreting and inferring explicit causal theories about the world from implicit knowledge captured by deep learning.},

  abstract = {To extract information from the clustering of galaxies on non-linear scales, we need to model the connection between galaxies and halos accurately and in a flexible manner. Standard halo occupation distribution (HOD) models make the assumption that the galaxy occupation in a halo is a function of only its mass, however, in reality, the occupation can depend on various other parameters including halo concentration, assembly history, environment, spin, etc. Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation as our target, we show that machine learning tools can be used to capture this high-dimensional dependence and provide more accurate galaxy occupation models. Specifically, we use a random forest regressor to identify which secondary halo parameters best model the galaxy-halo connection and symbolic regression to augment the standard HOD model with simple equations capturing the dependence on those parameters, namely the local environmental overdensity and shear, at the location of a halo. This not only provides insights into the galaxy-formation relationship but, more importantly, improves the clustering statistics of the modeled galaxies significantly. Our approach demonstrates that machine learning tools can help us better understand and model the galaxy-halo connection, and are therefore useful for galaxy formation and cosmology studies from upcoming galaxy surveys.},

Specifically, proportionate reproduction, ranking selection, tournament selection, and Genitor (or ``steady state'') selection are compared on the basis of solutions to deterministic difference or differential equations, which are verified through computer simulations. The analysis provides convenient approximate or exact solutions as well as useful convergence time and growth ratio estimates. The paper recommends practical application of the analyses and suggests a number of paths for more detailed analytical investigation of selection techniques.},

However, to deal with increasing amounts of data, we need ``machine scientists'' that are able to extract these models automatically from data. Here, we introduce a Bayesian machine scientist, which establishes the plausibility of models using explicit approximations to the exact marginal posterior over models and establishes its prior expectations about models by learning from a large empirical corpus of mathematical expressions. It explores the space of models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We show that this approach uncovers accurate models for synthetic and real data and provides out-of-sample predictions that are more accurate than those of existing approaches and of other nonparametric methods.},

When viewed in this way, the process of solving these problems becomes equivalent to searching a space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program. The recently developed genetic programming paradigm described herein provides a way to search the space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program to solve (or approximately solve) a surprising variety of different problems from different fields. In genetic programming, populations of computer programs are genetically bred using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest and using a genetic crossover (sexual recombination) operator appropriate for genetically mating computer programs. Genetic programming is illustrated via an example of machine learning of the Boolean 11-multiplexer function and symbolic regression of the econometric exchange equation from noisy empirical data.},

  abstract = {For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the ``alphabet'' used to describe those systems. An algorithm has been developed to search for natural laws of physics in large data sets. An algorithm has been developed to search for natural laws of physics in large data sets.},

We train neural networks using data from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project and show that the model can predict the total mass of a subhalo with high accuracy: more than 99\% of the subhalos have a predicted mass within 0.2 dex of their true value. The networks exhibit surprising extrapolation properties, being able to accurately predict the total mass of any type of subhalo containing any kind of galaxy at any redshift from simulations with different cosmologies, astrophysics models, subgrid physics, volumes, and resolutions, indicating that the network may have found a universal relation. We then use different methods to find equations that approximate the relation found by the networks and derive new analytic expressions that predict the total mass of a subhalo from its radius, velocity dispersion, and maximum circular velocity. We show that in some regimes, the analytic expressions are more accurate than the neural networks. We interpret the relation found by the neural network and approximated by the analytic equation as being connected to the virial theorem.},

In this work we apply modern ML methods to gravity models of pairwise interactions in international economics. We explain the formulation of graphical neural networks (GNNs), models for graph-structured data that respect the properties of exchangeability and locality. GNNs are a natural and theoretically appealing class of models for international trade, which we demonstrate empirically by fitting them to a large panel of annual-frequency country-level data. We then use a symbolic regression algorithm to turn our fits into interpretable models with performance comparable to state of the art hand-crafted models motivated by economic theory. The resulting symbolic models contain objects resembling market access functions, which were developed in modern structural literature, but in our analysis arise ab initio without being explicitly postulated. Along the way, we also produce several model-consistent and model-agnostic ML-based measures of bilateral trade accessibility.},
